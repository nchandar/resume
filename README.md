# Niranjan Resume

Professional resume source files in LaTeX, with a generated PDF included.

This repository contains:
- `resume_niranjan.tex` (main resume source)
- `resume_niranjan_onepage.tex` (one-page version)
- `Niranjan_Resume.pdf` (compiled output)

## Recommended Workflow (Overleaf)

Please use [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) as the online editor and PDF viewer to build or modify this resume.

### How to edit and build
1. Open [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) and create a new project.
2. Upload the `.tex` files from this repository.
3. Set the main file (`resume_niranjan.tex` or `resume_niranjan_onepage.tex`).
4. Use Overleaf's built-in compile/view tools to edit and preview changes.

## Notes

- Keep both `.tex` versions updated if you maintain multiple formats.
- Commit source changes along with the regenerated PDF when needed.
